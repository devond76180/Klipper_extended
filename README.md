My extended version of Klipper.  I created project from klipper because macros are for programmers.  
In the klipper project the answer is macros, they will cure everything.  I needed a feature and used 
already exisitng pull to get it done.  Project manager said it was not necessary since it could be done 
with a macro.  Problems is nobody would tell me how a macro could do it. If I dod nt know how as a 
long time programmer, realized macros were a dead end unless you wanted to create examples for everything
possible.  Macros are great, but do not really replace good functions.
